                        <p>For the most part, the song's lyrics imply that one's opinion of oneself is more
                            important than any other, and that you should not let others define you or
                            belittle.</p>

                        <p>This song is written with the intention of showing Dan's harsh interaction with his parents,
                            early in his life.

                        <p>It's a song that illustrates, both lyrically and vocally, the struggles for sobriety,
                            acting as a warning of the dangers that substance abuse can have</p>
